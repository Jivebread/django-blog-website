        <p>I am a Computer Science student with a passion for solving complicated problems in a great time complexity. Especially in the problem where efficiency of algorithms play a big role, I love to understand and research for better time complexity.</p> 
		<p>Also, I have worked on several websites as this blog and my computer science club's website and Ruby on Rails Rotten Tomatoes website where I learned TDD, BDD, Agile development.Now, I appreciate designs and efficiency of the code and love beautiful codes with a great test coverage.</p>
		<p>I am also a president of University's Machine learning club named, Kaggler as the university lacked infrastructure to join a research with graduate students for undergraduate students. Now, the club includes 3 professors on campus and 20 students since we started. My team, not club, have participated in 3 hackathons, but failed to get awards.</p>
		<p>These all say that I always worked to solve problems by constantly questioning what aspects I lack.</p>
